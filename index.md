## About Me


I am an MS/PhD student at KAUST, supervised by Dr. Mohamed Elhoseiny. I earned my bachelor's degree from the American University in Cairo (AUC) 2022. My research focuses on multimodal large language models (LLMs) and enabling LLMs to develop real-life reasoning capabilities with grounding skills.

I am particularly interested in multimodal LLMs, compositional understanding, and vision foundation models.
